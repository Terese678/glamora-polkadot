# GLAMORA
**Where Fashion Meets Web3**

A decentralized content marketplace empowering fashion creators through blockchain technology.

**Built on Moonbeam | Powered by IPFS | Secured by Smart Contracts**

## The Story Behind Glamora

As a fashion enthusiast and designer, I've watched talented creators lose 30-50% of their earnings to centralized platforms. Instagram, TikTok, Patreon - they all take massive cuts while controlling what you post, who sees it, and whether it stays up.

I asked myself: What if creators could own their content, set their own prices, and keep 100% of their earnings?

That's how Glamora was born.

---

## The Problem

Fashion creators face multiple barriers:

**High Platform Fees**
- YouTube takes 45%
- Patreon takes 12%
- OnlyFans takes 20%

**No True Ownership**
- Content lives on centralized servers
- Platforms control everything
- Can delete your work anytime

**Algorithm Dependency**
- Platforms decide who sees your work
- Especially harsh for creators in developing countries

**Arbitrary Censorship**
- Content removed without warning
- No appeals process

**Delayed Payments**
- Wait weeks for earnings
- High withdrawal minimums

---

## The Solution

Glamora provides:

- ✅ **Near-Zero Fees** - Only gas costs (pennies on Moonbeam)
- ✅ **True Ownership** - Content on IPFS, records on blockchain
- ✅ **Direct Discovery** - No algorithm middleman
- ✅ **Censorship Resistant** - Immutable blockchain records
- ✅ **Instant Payments** - Withdraw earnings anytime

---

## How It Works

### For Creators
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
2. Register as a creator (one-time, on-chain)
3. Upload your content (image/video)
4. Content goes to IPFS, hash stored on blockchain
5. Set your price in DEV tokens
6. Earn 100% of sales, withdraw instantly

### For Users
1. Browse content (no wallet needed!)
2. Connect wallet to purchase
3. One-click purchase with MetaMask
4. View purchased content on IPFS forever
5. Full transaction history on blockchain

---

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)

**GlamoraHub.sol - The Brain**
- Manages creator registry
- Validates creator status
- Coordinates between contracts

**CreatorProfile.sol - The Identity**
- Stores creator information
- Manages profile metadata
- Links wallet addresses to identities

**ContentPayment.sol - The Money**
- Handles content uploads
- Processes purchases
- Manages revenue distribution

### Frontend Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast builds
- ethers.js v5 for blockchain interaction
- Custom CSS with luxury design system
- MetaMask integration

### Storage Layer

**Why IPFS?**
- Content can't be deleted (immutable)
- Distributed globally (censorship-resistant)
- No single point of failure
- Fast retrieval via Pinata gateway

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20 or higher
- MetaMask browser extension
- DEV tokens from Moonbase Alpha faucet

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash

npm install
cd ..
```

**3. Configure environment**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_moonbase_private_key

**6. Launch the app**
```bash
cd glamora-frontend
npm run dev
```

## Design Philosophy

Fashion meets functionality.

- **Dark Luxury** - #0a0a0a background

## Build Journey

### Weeks 1-2: Smart Contracts
- Designed three-contract architecture
- Implemented creator registration system
- Built content management logic
- Added secure payment handling

### Weeks 3-4: The Struggles
- ❌ Contracts wouldn't deploy → ✅ Fixed Solidity version
- ❌ Contract interactions failing → ✅ Corrected ABI imports
- ❌ IPFS uploads timing out → ✅ Switched to Pinata

### Weeks 5-6: Frontend & Polish
- Built luxury UI with custom CSS
- Integrated MetaMask wallet
- Created creator and user dashboards
- Implemented IPFS content viewing
- ❌ Function name mismatches → ✅ Used correct ABI methods

### The Result
A working decentralized marketplace where creators upload in seconds, content lives forever on IPFS, and purchases happen on-chain with full transparency.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

**"content is not a function" error**
- Problem: Called wrong contract method
- Solution: Used `getContent()` from actual ABI
- Learning: Always verify ABI exports

**Broken IPFS URLs**
- Problem: Test data had fake hashes
- Solution: Filtered out test content
- Learning: Clean test data before demos

**Half-screen layout**  
- Problem: DevTools affected CSS
- Solution: Added proper viewport settings
- Learning: Test with DevTools closed

### What I'd Do Differently
- Start with proper TypeScript types from day one
- Write contract tests before deployment
- Use Remix IDE for faster contract debugging
- Deploy to testnet earlier in development

---

## Why Moonbeam?

I chose Moonbeam because:

- **EVM Compatible** - My Solidity skills transferred perfectly
- **Fast & Cheap** - Uploads cost pennies, confirm in seconds
- **Great Documentation** - Clear examples, active community
- **Real Substrate** - Connected to Polkadot ecosystem
- **Production Ready** - Not just a testnet toy

Moonbase Alpha handled everything I threw at it. Zero downtime. Fast confirmations. Perfect for content platforms.

---

## Platform Sustainability

**Current Implementation:** Creators receive 100% to demonstrate zero-fee capability.

**Production Options:**
- Optional 2-5% platform fee (still 90%+ better than Web2)
- Covers IPFS pinning, gas optimization, development
- Community governance for fee decisions
- Premium features for advanced creators

This proves the technology works. Business model is flexible and community-driven.

## Polkadot Hackathon 2025

**Theme:** User-Centric Apps

This project demonstrates how Polkadot's technology stack (through Moonbeam) creates real-world impact for content creators, staying true to Web3 principles of ownership, transparency, and user empowerment.

**Radically Useful:**
- Solves real creator pain points
- Works today (not just a concept)
- Built on production-ready technology
- Generates actual value for users

**Radically Open:**
- 100% open source
- Fully transparent on-chain
- No gatekeepers
- Permissionless participation
